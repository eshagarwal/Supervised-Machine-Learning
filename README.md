# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of supervised machine learning algorithms from scratch, focusing on linear regression and multiple regression.

### Overview
### Algorithms Included:
  - Linear Regression [Code](./Linear%20Regression%20with%20Gradient%20Descent/LinearReg_GradientDescent.ipynb)
  - Multiple Regression [Code](./Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20with%20Gradient%20Descent/Multiple_linear_reg.ipynb)

### Each Algorithm Features:
- A brief explanation of the algorithm.
- The mathematical formulation used.
- Cost function derivation.
- Gradient descent implementation.

### Problem Statement
- Example: 
  - A house with **1000 square feet** sold for **$300,000**.
  - A house with **2000 square feet** sold for **$500,000**.
- These two points constitute our **training set**:
  
| Size (1000 sqft) | Price (1000s of dollars) |
| ------------------| ------------------------- |
| 1.0               | 300                       |
| 2.0               | 500                       |

- The goal is to fit a linear regression model through these points to predict prices for other houses, such as a house with **1200 sqft**.
